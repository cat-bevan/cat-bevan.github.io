Transgender identities and the LGBTQ+ community at large has long been seen as a 'left-wing' movement, violating the 'traditional family values' held by many conservatives. From my experiences in the LGBTQ+ community, I can absolutely attest that there is a major correlation between LGBTQ+ identities and anti-establishment leftist political leanings. From 'conversion therapy', unaccepting families, to targeted assualts, conservative ideas and practices have directly harmed and even killed many transpeople, and it is unsurprising to see a deep political rift between the LGBTQ+ community and the right. The question then, is how does this divide manifest itself in trans-related headlines?

Before delving into the data, it serves to review my news sources and their political leanings.

### The Toronto Star
Canada's largest newspaper, The Toronto Star openly "champions liberal causes", often with a capital 'L'. The Liberal Party of Canada is the middle-ground, centrist party of Canada's political sphere, and The Toronto Star has taken a similar stance since it was established in the 1920's.

### Buzzfeed News
Starting out as a conglomeration of click-bait videos targeting teens, Buzzfeed now employs a very competent news team that has broke some incredibly important stories, including publishing the Steele Dossier, the leaked emails of right-wing populist Milo Yiannopoulos, and Kevin Spacey's sexual misconduct accusation. Politically, they are decidedly left-wing.

### The Daily Mail
The highest-circulated daily newspaper in the UK, The Daily Mail is a right-wing tabloid with a primarily older audience. Established in 1896, *Daily Mail* has received countless criticisms for printing sensationalist and populist stories.

### The Independent
Another UK news source, *The Independent* started as a printed paper in 1986 before transitioning to online-only in 2016. Politcally, they are best described as center-right, with a strong pro-market stance, but more socially liberal views than conservative.

### HuffPost
During the creation of this project, *HuffPost* has actually been acquired by BuzzFeed. An American online-only news aggregator formed in 2005, *HuffPost* is described as liberal-leaning, though their founder maintains that *HuffPost* is "not positioned ideologically in terms of how we cover the news". Much of its content is rooted in a blogging background.

It is worth noting again that these sources were chosen for this project primarily due to the ease of webscraping their online archives for an amateur like me. No purposeful bias was given to left-leaning media. For the purposes of this section, I scrapped one more site on the right-wing side of the media-sphere to balance the field;

### Breitbart News
*Breitbart* is a notoriously far-right American commentary website founded in 2007 that is known to actively engage with white-supremacy and neo-Nazi ideology. Due to the nature of their archives, I was only able to scrape around 12-13 months of headlines. As such, they are not included in the rest of the project.

## Percentage of trans-related headlines across different outlets
The first question I sought to answer was how these news outlets differed in the percentage of trans-related stories they publish. To even the playing field with *Breitbart*'s limited number of headlines, I limited my analysis to 2020. This still provided approximately a million headlines for the analysis, and the results are as follows:

1. *Breitbart*: 0.321% of 2020 stories are trans-related
2. *HuffPost*: 0.312% of 2020 stories are trans-related
3. *The Independent*: 0.113% of 2020 stories are trans-related
4. *The Toronto Star*: 0.0862% of 2020 stories are trans-related
5. *Daily Mail*: 0.0761% of 2020 stories are trans-related
6. *BuzzFeed*: 0.0460% of 2020 stories are trans-related

It's a fascinating spread, with some serious surprises. The most important matter to address, is that the far-right 'news' source *Breitbart* writes about transpeople more often than the other news outlets surveyed. I will not mince my words; the far-right has an irrational fixation on transpeople as a deviant subspecies that poses some kind of danger to 'normal', white cishet society. This will become clearer when I compare the language used in these headlines.

*HuffPost* trails not far behind. Looking through their 2020 headlines, they cover much of the news surrounding transgender law and violence against transpeople, even outside the US. Combined with a following of blog-style celebrity news following trans YouTube stars, the trans-daughter of basketball star Dwayne Wade, their percentage of trans headlines consists of both professional stories on serious topics and blog-style articles on pop-culture.

There's a significant drop-off between *HuffPost* and *The Independent*. I would wager this has to do with *The Independent* (and by extension *The Toronto Star*) only publishing trans stories which fit the greater scope of their more serious publishing. I have a more difficult time explaining the position of *Daily Mail* and particularly *BuzzFeed*. Seeing *BuzzFeed* with nearly 1/10th the percentage of trans headlines as its now-child media outlet *HuffPost* is very perplexing. 

With this information, which is admittedly very limited in scope, no conclusions can be drawn in regards to which side of the political spectrum publishes more trans-related headlines. Moving on to the specific language used.

## Differences in language across different outlets

First, a look at trans stories from *HuffPost*;

As discussed in transmen vs. transwomen representation, it is no surprise to see 'woman' being the most represented word in trans-related headlines. HuffPost covers a variety of topics in high frequency, including the trans daughter of Dwayne Wade, the banning of transwomen athletes in Idaho, and various topics surrounding trans youth. In comparison, let's look at the language used in trans headlines from *Breitbart*;

<iframe style='width: 637px; height: 511px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?palette=d3_cat20b&stopList=keywords-67626b758aed868bb65b07441f30204d&whiteList=&visible=25&corpus=aa7cc7a6c00d4f0ae59507e7830866f8'></iframe>

Three things in particular stand out to me. The first, is 'protect'. Included in headlines such as "WaPo Reveals Natural Alliance of Conservatives’
and Feminists’ Efforts to Protect Children from Transgender Treatment", "Idaho First State to Protect Women’s Sports from Transgender Athletes" and "Transgender: HUD Issues Rule to Protect Women in Homeless Shelters", the alt-right clearly perceives trans identities as a danger to kids, cis atheletes, and ciswomen. These are old fears that have been debunked countless times by countless sources, but I suppose the far-right isn't known for their qualitative reasoning. It's vehement and blatant transphobia that is somehow still acceptable in some public circles, even after homophobia is kept out of these very same circles. 

Second feature of note, is the grammatical incorrectness and quotes so frequently used around the word transgender. Using slurs is apparently below them, but headlines such as "Review Ordered of NHS Rules on ‘Transgender’ Teens’ Medical Treatments", "Female Inmate Claims She Was Raped by Transgender ‘Woman’ Moved into Housing Unit", "Report Claims Transgenders Being Denied ‘Lifesaving’ Surgery" and "YouTube Censors Heritage Foundation Video Featuring Former Transgender" fill that gap of not using a slur just fine. In other news outlets, incorrect usage of transgender as a noun was largely phased out by 2012 (discussed in changes in trans-related language post). Eight years later, it's nothing but purposeful insults.

Lastly, I'd like to mention the frequent presence of Joe Biden. Biden has made several statements over the course of the election cycle in support of trans rights and identites. Interestingly, the far-right publishes more stories to mock and attack these statements than left-wing outlets publish stories supporting these comments.

### Simularities and differences between stories covered in different geographical regions

This is one aspect of my data set that I don't feel I have a large enough sample-size to make definite conclusions from. Given that I have only scrapped headlines from English-speaking US, Canada, and the UK, the stories that are covered are rather homogenous. In this limited sphere of media, I have found there to be greater differences between left and right-wing news sources from the same country than between two left-leaning sources in different parts of the world. Expanding this project to include non-English headlines and English headlines from other parts of Europe, Hong-Kong, Australia, etc., would make for very interesting research.
