title: "Transmen vs. transwomen media representation"

Immediately apparent after isolating trans-related headlines from my dataset, was the stark difference in representation between transwomen and transmen. This comes as little surprise, but seeing it in numbers - approx. 700 headlines directly referencing transwomen vs. approx. 250 directly referencing men - serves as undeniable evidence of this trend in media representation. Below is a visual representation of the language used across all five of my news outlets in their trans-related headlines.

## Many trans-related headlines with male-coded language are not stories about transmen

Making matters worse, many of these headlines which do include the word 'man', 'men', or 'male', are in fact headlines which refer to men who have killed, abused, or otherwise harmed transwomen. This dwindles the number of headlines truly addressing transmen even further. I went and extracted all 200+ trans-related headlines including male-coded language, and immediately apparent is that the most common word in these headlines is actually 'woman'.

Some selected headlines from the bunch to help paint a picture; "Texas Man Gets 10 Years Probation For Death Of Transgender Woman", "Caitlyn Jenner Apologised For Saying A Trans Woman Shouldn't Look Like 'A Man In A Dress'", "'If she did want to check if I'm a man she'd be impressed': Donald Trump spars with transgender Beauty Queen", and "Transgender woman Davina Ayrton sent to male prison after rape conviction". These are, once again, actually the stories of transwomen. 

Demographically, it has been said that transwomen do in fact outnumber transmen. Demographics of transpeople are difficult to obtain and vary drastically between cultures, but studies suggest that, *at most*, transwomen outnumber transmen at a 1.5-2:1 ratio(demo temp trends). This is not a fair answer to the approximately 4-5:1 ratio of headlines specifically refering to transwomen over transmen.   

## Trans-related 'debates' focus heavily on transwomen over transmen 

Some of the most common 'debates' involving transpeople focus entirely on transwomen, ignoring a whole half of the trans community. For example, the 'bathroom' debate. Those who claim that transpeople should be forced to use the bathroom of their birth gender are really only referring to transwomen; seeing them gaining access to women's spaces as a 'threat'. This debate almost always fails to address that by this ruling, transmen would be using women's bathrooms. The same exact issue arises in the debate surrounding trans-athletes. The argument is presented that transwomen athletes (on HRT with estrogen levels and muscle-mass comparable to ciswomen) present an unfair challenge to ciswomen athletes. This again completely ignores that grouping athletes solely based on birth gender would also result in transmen (with testosterone levels and muscle-mass comparable to cismen) being matched with ciswomen atheletes instead.
