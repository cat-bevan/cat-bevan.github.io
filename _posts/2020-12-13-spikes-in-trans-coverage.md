title: "Spikes in trans-related headline coverage; what stories garnered the most media attention?"

Trans-related headlines were virtually non-existant prior to 2010. It wasn't until 2013 that trans stories saw semi-regular coverage, steadily growing with a handful of peaks in 2016 and 2017. Below is a visualization, taking into account all five of my news sources. Hover the bars to read the headlines themselves.

## 2012;

With 15 trans-related headlines, the first month of 2012 marks a growing number of trans stories. In this case, the small spike was mostly due to controversy surrounding transgender girl scouts coinciding with a growing trans-presence in popular media, such as GLEE. May 2012 saw the largest numbers yet, mostly driven by the Toronto Star and their coverage of a transwoman model competing in the Miss Canada competition. Towards the end of the year, populist media, such as The Daily Mail in the case of my dataset, began pushing more trans headlines. With charming headlines like "Michele Obama played by TRANGENDER actor", "'The bikini's are so tiny...': Brazil's trangender models on hitting the catwalk", and "I'm having a sex change to look like Harry Styles: transgender girl models new look on One Direction Star", transpeople are treated not unlike a circus show. 

## 2013;

The first half of 2013 shows little change. August and September see new record numbers of trans-headlines, carried almost entirely by The Huffington Post and their coverage of US-specific trans politics and stories. 'Transparent', a well-received TV show about a 'trans-parent' was produced, and a growing amount of stories focused particularly on trans children, including prom and homecoming stories. 

## 2014;

2014 saw the recognition of transgender actress Laverne Cox - from the at-the-time popular TV show *Orange is the New Black* - as a major activist for trans rights. Populist, drama-stirring headlines continue to form the majority of stories.

## 2015;

January 2015 saw the suicide of 17-year-old transgirl Leelah Alcorn, an American teen with religiously conservative and unaccepting parents. Her story in combination with an international focus on discrimatory laws brought about the largest spike in trans stories to date. May brought around another unsurprising record high, as Caitlyn Jenner, a former Olympian with ties to the Kardashian family, came out as a transwoman. 2015 saw a very consistent increase in trans-related headlines, with every month holding above the highest from 2014.

## 2016;

To my surprise, 2016 holds the record for most trans-related headlines in a single month - over 120 stories in May. April and May saw large commotion over transgender bathroom laws while the US was in the midst of their election cycle which led to Donald Trump being the Republican nomination. Debate over American laws also coincided with Canadian laws at the time, with the Liberal's tabling a trans rights bill that saw many iterations and debate. The combination of Obama passing pro-trans laws before the election and the Republicans battling over trans bathroom laws to win the nomination caused a very high volume of polical headlines across all news sources. 

## 2017;

The political and law-oriented trend continues into 2017, with a large spike in February linked to Trump's axing of trans protections, and an even larger spike in July and August in regards to Trump's banning of transpeople from the military. Much like the April/May spike of 2016, it seems that politics-related trans-headlines spike and fade quickly. 

## 2018 to present day

Interestingly, and against my expectations, trans-headlines have not seen any large spikes over the past 2 years - rather, they have seen troughs. Of particular note is the massive drop to only 12 trans-headlines in April, 2020. As I'm sure everyone remembers, this was the month that the COVID-19 pandemic began to really sink its claws into international society. In fact so far, trans-headlines have seen consistently lower number than 2019. A small rise in trans-stories across March-June of 2019 coincides with Trumps attempted implementation of the transgender military ban, and an onslaught of killings and hate crimes targetted at transpeople across the US.

## Conclusions

Looking at the data, it is clear that political headlines surrounding controversy on trans-related laws - whether it's on bathrooms, sports, or the military - result in the largest spikes in trans media coverage. However, these spikes fade within one or two months. On the other hand, mainstream media representation, whether it's trans celebrities or TV-shows featuring trans stories, seem to result in a slightly more drawn-out rise in trans headlines. 'GLEE', 'Transparent', Caitlyn Jenner, and Laverne Cox have all seen consistent media presence in trans stories, and likely seem to influence the rise in trans visibility from 2012-2016. Meanwhile, the constants of the trans news world seem to be populist 'stories' which often objectify, sexualize, and otherwise disrespect trans identities, and headlines of hate crimes, beatings, and killings targetting transpeople. As seen in 2020, world-events besides trans-related issues also have profound effects on the number of trans headlines in a given month.
