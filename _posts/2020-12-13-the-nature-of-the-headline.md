title: "The Nature of the Digital Headline"

The digital headline is a fickle subject, and possesses qualities that stand apart from their legacy newspaper counterparts. To quote Kuiken et. al, in their article "*Effective Headlines of Newspaper Articles in a Digital Environment*"; 

> "Previously, the primary function of a headline was to give the reader, who was scanning the newspaper, a clear understanding of what the article was about (Van Dijk 1988). But since many headlines are not read within the context of a newspaper anymore, the function of the headline has shifted. The headline, being one of the primary ways to attract the readersâ€™ attention, should above all make the reader curious as to what the article is about, so that it lures the reader into opening the article (Chen, Conroy, and Rubin 2015)" (Kuiken, Schuth, Spitters, and Marx 2017). 

I feel that the nature of curiosity-inducing headlines has had a profound affect on trans-related media coverage, especially within the scope of a project which focuses solely on headlines. To many people, certain aspects of trans-identities are particularly curiosity-inducing, and it is my belief that headlines reflecting these curiosities are over represented in my dataset and news media at large.

## Trans-fetishization as a generator of click-bait

The first of these, is the sexualization and fetishization of trans bodies. It is a pervasive, and common issue. In the trans community, we refer to men who are attracted specifically to the 'transness' (the fact that most have penises) of a transwoman, as 'chasers'. Pornography featuring transpeople has been a mainstay of porn production for a decade, and has steadily risen in [PornHub's search statistics](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/transgender-searches). According to porn-provider *GameLink* in an article by *Vice*, the [number one best-selling title in several States features a transwoman](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pg7jgv/take-a-guess-at-what-the-most-downloaded-kind-of-porn-is-in-anti-lgbt-states). This can also be quantized by looking at the frequency of the word 'model' in trans-related headlines;

Coming in 9th, just behind 'Trump', 'model' is grossly over-represented. Keep in mind, this is from all of my news sources aggregated together. When you isolate just *Daily Mail*, the most populist of my news sources, 'model' rises all the way up to fifth;

To be clear, trans models are incredibly important, and transpeople of all identities should feel sexually comfortable and confident in their bodies. Countless healthy relationships exist between cispeople and transpeople. It is just that the sexualization of transpeople is over-represented in mainstream media. The sexual 'taboo' nature that many cispeople perceive in trans bodies results in easy clicks in a digital news world.

## Imbalanced ratio between stories featuring transwomen and transmen as a result of cultural taboo

In a similar vein, I believe the bias towards transwomen in trans-related headlines is influenced in part by the prevalence of curiosity-inducing digital headlines. For example; for whatever reason, social gender expectations dictate a woman in men's clothing is nothing special, while a man in women's clothing is downright scandalous. Other topics discussed in the page on transwomen vs. transmen media represention, such as transwomen-centric 'bathroom debates', narrow in on cultural taboos surrounding 'male bodies' and femininity - no matter how incorrect these perceptions are. Taboos, whether they're cultural or sexual, generate curiosity in their readers, leading to so-called 'successful' digital headlines with many clicks.

## Digital native news sources vs. legacy press newspapers; a look at Billard's research

Of my five primary sources, two are digital native (meaning they were first formed in a digital environment online), two are legacy press with digital websites (meaning their news began with printed newspaper), and one started as legacy press before transitioning solely to digital native. *Breitbart*, from which I have scrapped a year's worth of headlines for comparisons between left and right-wing media, is also digital native.

##### Digital Native
* *BuzzFeed*
* *HuffPost*
* (*Breitbart*)
##### Legacy Press
* *Toronto Star*
* *Daily Mail*
##### Legacy Press to Digital Native
* *The Independent*

Research carried out by Thomas J Billard sought to find relationships in trans-related media between digital native and legacy press sources. His findings, summarized in "*Setting the transgender agenda: intermedia agenda-setting in the digital news environment*"(2017), state that digital native news sources influence the content of legacy press in trans-related news. His methods of research present a couple of advantages as well as a couple of areas for improvement in comparison to my own. Billard lists the strings searched for as only four; 'transgender', 'transgendered', 'transsexual', and 'transexual'. In comparison, I use a minimum of thirteen, including 'transwoman'/'transwomen', 'transman'/'transmen', 'transperson', and variations which use spaces in-between. While 'transgender' is responsible for the majority of 'hits', 'transwoman' saw dozens of hits through my dataset as well. However, Billard does have a larger number of news sources to pull from. Billard takes the five most popular digital native news sources, as well as the five most popular legacy press sources, for a total of 10 sources - double my own. Billard's findings tackle a two-year time span, between the beginning of 2014, and the end of 2015. It is odd to me that he did not decide to include 2016, which by my metrics, had the highest quantity of trans-related stories. Nevertheless, his research formed the backbone of my own. 

Billard goes on to determine that digital native news publishes more stories than legacy press, and that more often than not, digital native news addresses areas of trans-related stories *before* their legacy press counterparts. However, there is not a large difference between types of trans-related content; just that digital native press covers trans stories more often and are the first to jump on new trans topics. This is an important distinction; however, I found it odd that Billard never mentions the political-allignment of any of his sources as a variable to be taken into account. 

As I discussed in 'left-wing vs. right-wing media representation', language and topics of trans-related news coverage can vary significantly between leftist and far-right sources. Looking at Billard's sources, there is a significant left-leaning in his digital native sources, and a significant center-leaning in his native press sources. This is unsurprising, given that Billard's sole consideration in chosen sources was popularity; legacy press holds an older reader audience than digital native, and political leanings are consistently more right-wing or centrist in legacy press than digital native sources. This begs the question; is the quantity of trans-related stories and the precedence for Billard's digital native sources to address trans topics before native press sources a result of differences in media format, or political leanings? As demonstrated in my dataset by *Breitbart*, not *all* digital native sources are left-leaning. Answering this question with any degree of certainty would require a greater set of data, pulling from both the left and the right-leaning sources.
