title: "The Nature of the Digital Headline"

The digital headline is a fickle subject, and possess qualities that stand apart from their legacy newspaper counterparts. To quote Kuiken et. al, in their article *EFFECTIVE HEADLINES OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES IN A DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT*; 

> "Previously, the primary function of a headline was to give the reader, who was scanning the newspaper, a clear understanding of what the article was about (Van Dijk 1988). But since many headlines are not read within the context of a newspaper anymore, the function of the headline has shifted. The headline, being one of the primary ways to attract the readersâ€™ attention, should above all make the reader curious as to what the article is about, so that it lures the reader into opening the article (Chen, Conroy, and Rubin 2015)" (Kuiken, Schuth, Spitters, and Marx 2017). 

I feel that the nature of curiosity-inducing headlines has had a profound affect on trans-related media coverage, especially within the scope of a project which focuses solely on headlines. To many people, certain aspects of trans-identities are particularly curiosity-inducing, and it is my belief that headlines reflecting these curiosities are over represented in my dataset and news media at large.

## Trans-fetishization as a generator of click-bait

The first of these, is the sexualization and fetishization of trans bodies. It is a pervasive, and common issue. In the trans community, we refer to men who are attracted specifically to the 'transness' (the fact that most have penises) of a transwoman, as 'chasers'. Pornography featuring transpeople has been a mainstay of porn production for a decade, and has steadily risen in [PornHub's search statistics](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/transgender-searches). According to porn-provider *GameLink* in an article by *Vice*, the [number one best-selling title in several States features a transwoman](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pg7jgv/take-a-guess-at-what-the-most-downloaded-kind-of-porn-is-in-anti-lgbt-states). This can also be quantized by looking at the frequency of the word 'model' in trans-related headlines;

Coming in 9th, just behind 'Trump', 'model' is grossly over-represented. Keep in mind, this is from all of my news sources aggregated together. When you isolate just *Daily Mail*, the most populist of my news sources, 'model' rises all the way up to fifth;

To be clear, trans models are incredibly important, and transpeople of all identities should feel sexually comfortable and confident in their bodies. Countless healthy relationships exist between cispeople and transpeople. It is just that the sexualization of transpeople is over-represented in mainstream media. The sexual 'taboo' nature that many cispeople perceive in trans bodies results in easy clicks in a digital news world.

## Imbalanced ratio between stories featuring transwomen and transmen

In a similar vein, I believe the bias towards transwomen in trans-related headlines is influenced in part by the prevalence of curiosity-inducing digital headlines. For example; for whatever reason, social gender expectations dictate a woman in men's clothing is nothing special, while a man in women's clothing is downright scandalous.
