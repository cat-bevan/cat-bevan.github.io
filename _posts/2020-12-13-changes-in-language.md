The word 'transgender' has only gained familiarity over the last decade. Previously, 'transsexual' was the most commonly used, and it wasn't uncommon for even news sources to use the slur 'tranny'. In the trans community, transgender is almost always the preferred term over transsexual, as many feel that 'transsexual' emphasizes the nature of their sexual organs and birth sex. Gender on the other hand, is widely accepted in the scientific, medical, and psychological community to be fluid, socially-derived, and on a spectrum. 

Below is a representation of how the use of 'transsexual' (or the mispelt 'transexual') has faded over time. Interestingly enough however, is the sudden spike in 2020 of the word 'transgendered' - a word that is not even grammatically correct. 'Transgender' is an adjective. Calling someone 'transgendered' is linguistically equivalent to calling someone 'happied', 'blacked', or 'talled'.
