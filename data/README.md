# The Data

This folder contains all scripts used and .csv files created over the course of the project. Often, the raw webscraped data will be left in a messy state, but are cleaned up through the various scripts I run them through. Some of these scripts are two months old and are more amateur than others.

.csv files such as 'dailymail.csv' contain all headlines from the beginning of their archives with no filters. 'dailymailDF.csv' and other such .csv are only the trans-related headlines for use in dataframes. These DF.csv files are generated through the completeHeadlineAnalysis.py script.

bokehVBar.py is responsible for everything seen in the interactive and live updating graph.
