# The Data

This folder contains all scripts used and .csv files created over the course of the project. Often, the raw webscraped data will be left in a messy state, but are cleaned up through the various scripts I run them through. Some of these scripts are two months old and are more amateur than others.

The raw .csv files containing every headline from each news source are as large as 250MB and are too large for GitHub storage. The 'DF.csv' files contain only trans-related headlines. completeHeadlineAnalysis.py is the script which takes the large unfiltered .csv's to create DF.csv's for use in dataframes later on.

bokehVBar.py is responsible for everything seen in the interactive and live updating graph.
